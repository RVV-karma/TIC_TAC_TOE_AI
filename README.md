# TIC_TAC_TOE_AI
An unbeatable AI Tic Tac Toe game!!!

This is GUI game using Tkinter in Python.
You could directly download the executable file to run the game (for Windows only).

The game basically has 2 modes:
## 1. Two Player Mode
As the name suggest, you can play with your partner.
## 2. AI Mode
This is an unbeatable AI mode, where the second player is itself computer. Dare to win!
This mode is achieved by using Minimax Algorithm with and without using Alpha-Beta Pruning Method.

Since I have used cleckbox to start AI mode, you could start AI mode in middle of the two player mode.
(Thus you could win against AI, but by cheating!!)
Note: The 1st move after clicking AI mode is yours.
